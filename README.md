# PT-PT Layout for Logitech G613 Keyboard in MacOS

Based on [bitfhacker](http://github.com/bitfhacker)'s [ms-wired-keyboard-600](https://github.com/bitfhacker/ms-wired-keyboard-600)'s project. But modified for my Mechanical Logitech G613 Wireless keyboard.

Story is too well known. I don't like Apple's keyboard and Apple's layout, but my company issues Mac's for it's developers. Therefore, it's hacking time! I used a project for another keyboard to modify my own version and shared here with the comunity. I hope it help other Portuguese developers facing the same problem than I.

To install copy both files to ~/Library/Keyboard Layouts
Then, go to System Preferences, Keyboard, Input Sources, Others, than select "Pt-PT (gustavohmsilva)".
